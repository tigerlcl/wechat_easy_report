# Wechat Friends Easy Report

In this project, we would like to introduce a powerful and light-weight third library that was called `wxpy` to help you know more on your wechat friends. Click Link https://github.com/youfou/wxpy if you want to know more about it.

During the process, you will get familiar with those fundmental steps on data analysis, like data extraction(collection), data wrangling, exploratory analysis and visualization.

__Attention__<br>
It is NOT recommended to use a personal WeChat account on testing `wxpy`  due to the gradual restriction on Web Wechat Login Interface
